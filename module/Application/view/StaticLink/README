This module installs a view helper for generating links to static resources that reside on a subdomain (e.g. http://static.mydomain.com/images/image.jpg). Please note that performance can be improved by not using a standalone module to install the view helper. For information on how to install the helper in an alternative way, please visit the link at the bottom.


# Usage (within a view script):
<?php echo $this->staticLink('my_picture.jpg', StaticLink\View\Helper\StaticLink::IMAGE, array('profiles', 'admins')); ?>

Output:
http://static.mydomain.com/images/profiles/admins/my_picture.jpg


The first parameter is the name of the file to create a link to.
The second parameter is the name of the subfolder (optional). This will usually use one of the constants defined within the view helper class.
The third parameter is an array of subdirectories to include between the subfolder and file name.
